##Refactoring Projecct

    The goal behind this project was to clean up the origianl code. Whcich started out as a bit of mess to say the least. It wasn't condensed nor did it seem to follow in particular order. 
    I added a few class through out the html and the css(stylesheet). Commented out where section begins. In the html I made a few comments in regard to the first few articles; this was more so for myself in order to tackle each article one at at time.
    I was learning to use semantics with this projecet well really the basics all together you could say. I was focusing on using semantics cause I'm not familiar with common uses and practices as of yet. I was also focusing on the use of my comments in both HTML and CSS; make these commets for me is a way of being able to tell I understand and I'm retaining the informantion I am learning.
